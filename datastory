Working on a Data Story

Here, we go over some questions that are helpful to tell a story with data.
The dataset comes from a volunteered sample of 59946 cases from a dating
website called OkCupid.

Can you count something interesting?
  Yes, for each variable such as:  languages and ethnicity, we can make
  counts for each user. We then can use the counts to make correlations
  with other variables such as education level or even income.
  
Can you find some trends (high, low, increase, decrease, anomalities)?
  Yes, the users with high-level education tend to earn a higher income.
  However, users with more than 3 declared ethnicities tend to have
  other erratic traits such as extremely low/high heights, income, and
  essays.
  
Can you make a bar plot or a histogram?
  Yes to both. A bar plot will be used to compare independent data such
  as male vs female users or sexuality of users. A histogram will be
  used to account for income, height, and age.
  
Can you compare two related quantities?
  Yes. In this case, we will make subgroups. For example, we can group
  male vs female. We then can subgroup by variables such as body type,
  income, or even height.
  
Can you make a scatterplot?
  Yes, we can then use the scatterplot to make correlations. We can
  compare variables such as income level and education. Is it true that
  better education is related to higher income?
  
Can you make a time-series plot?
  No, we can not. The variable data that are used are not evaluated based
  on responses collected over time.
