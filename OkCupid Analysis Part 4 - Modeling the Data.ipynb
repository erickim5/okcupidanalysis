    "Our final part of our analysis is focused on modeling the data with the help of Machine Learning. The overall intention here is to be able to predict data to help OkCupid users match more easily. We are going to be focusing on text data. Since we are using text, not numbers, we use classifiers. We have labeled data and are trying to predict categories so we use the Naive Bayes method.\n",

(i know, totally clich, but it's true!)   rocking my cat like a baby.   making <b>epic</b> messes in the kitchen.   <a class=\"ilink\" href=\"/interests?i=singing\">singing</a> while no one's listening. i'm too <b>shy</b> to serenade anyone or sing karaoke, but i think that my shower makes for a nice pretend studio. if you ask nicely i might record a song for you. pretty much anything you request. no one ever takes me up on this offer!   <a class=\"ilink\" href=\"/interests?i=making+lists\">making lists</a>. i was unaware of this talent until i joined okc. wondering how i can parlay this into a new career. waffling. <a href=\"http://bit.ly/guineasaurus\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">battling guineasaurus-rexes</a>. <b>&lt;-- clicky</b>.    planning my first ever trip to japan!  <b>()()    </b>  <b></b>!!    totally <b>not</b> missing the world of academia, but totally missing watching brains in action live or under the 'scope. hey, i said watching brains, not eating. don't be afraid. i guess i also miss shooting the shit with cosmonauts in orbit. they're the reason why i acquired the most atrocious russian accent. <b>01101000 01101001!</b> (btw, as much as i appreciate your effort, please refrain from writing to me in binary, guys. it's getting kinda old.)    i am zany, zesty, and zeppelin-loving (what happened to the three-word descriptor? i kinda liked that profile feature)... anyway, i'm full of <b>fail</b> when it comes to describing myself. so yeah, here goes nothin'...     people always assume things about me and they are often wrong...   i am 2\" (5.08cm) taller than a sitting giant panda and i'm the same height as a fully grown lion. yeah, you read that right. i totally used the si in that sentence. i blame science.   i enjoy taking things apart and putting them back together again.   i'm an <a class=\"ilink\" href=\"/interests?i=intj\">intj</a>, if that means anything to you.   i was <b>rejected by eharmony</b>. success!   i'm right-handed and i've always worn watches on my right wrist instead of my left. yes, i'm quite the rebel.   one of the best compliments i've ever received in my life has got to be, <b>\"omg you're just like macguyver!!\"</b>   i like the word <i>nougat</i> more than i like the candy itself.   i almost <b>hit a grizzly bear</b> with my old car (her name was bertha, rip). i almost tried to grab my camera to take a picture of the bear, but then i decided that my life was more valuable than a digital image that would get posted on myspace and subsequently be forgotten as fast as you can say, \"i hate hipsters\".   <b>(3/11/11)</b> meh. haven't been on here much over the past year or so. sorry for the slow/late responses and lack of oddities being posted. <s>i've developed a <b>compulsive addiction</b> for updating my okcupid profile with various tidbits that invade my brain at any given time of the day. no, i will not apologize for my now obnoxiously long and self-indulgent profile. so yes, dear readers: <b>plz 5tay tun3d 4 m0ar</b>.</s>    <i>** one thing of note is that i'm mainly here looking for new friends and/or activity partners (especially show buddies and world travelers!), be they male, female, alien or panda :) **</i> \n",

      "you want to talk about something that is mentioned in my profile.    you are looking for someone with whom to take bicycle rides. while i used to do regular 30-50 mile rides, i was bikeless for about 6 months after a theft, and currently need to work back up.    you would like to put on fancy clothes and dance like a fairy prince|ss. (if you don't have the fancy clothes, my closet can provide for a shocking array of body types and gender expressions.)    please note that i'm sort of afraid of the phone. i consider my phone to be a mobile internet device slash texting device that happens to make and receive calls. i can be a texting fiend, but i irrationally hate voice calls.    for some reason, my milkshake always seems to be bringing the satanists to my yard. so satanists, i should warn you it's not going to happen. i'll still talk to you though. also, objectivists are satanists with different aesthetics.    if you have a vague idea of dating/making sweet fuck with me, you read that thing under my most-private-thing header about genderqueerness. i statistically find it easier to get along with people who identify as queer, genderqueer, pansexual, or bisexual (in a way that's not gotta-collect-them-all). i am in no way closed to straight men, but if you do not feel actively interested in queer and feminist issues even if you are straight-identified, then understand even friendship is going to be a tad strained. i'm also in no way closed to lesbian-identified women, but i find a similar tension between myself and people who identify as \"lesbian\" rather than \"queer\". i've got no issue with the fact that attraction is attraction, and part of that has to do with body parts, but if you can't respect my own lack of gender, we will have tension. (sometimes i like to roleplay gender in the boudoir, though. it's wrong and dirty.)    faq:  q: what kind of hair dye do you use, and where can i get it?  a: special effects electric blue. you can get it from amphigory (http://www.amphigory.com/special_effects_hairdye.html)    q: do you play/like changeling: the lost?  a: no    q: i have a boyfriend. would you like to be my/our girlfriend?  a: probably not, since you put it that way. if you just think i'm neat and are not commoditizing me as a poly all-gender-loving lady-ish-person, message me though. (nothing against the happiness-seeking of people who want a binary sexuality relationship setup, but that is not me.) *i like <a class=\"ilink\" href= \"/interests?i=changeling\">changeling</a>: the dreaming a little too much.    *this one time, i was sexually aroused by the thought of ayn rand and alan greenspan doing it.    *i have no gender identity. being assigned gender creeps me out. \"genderqueer\" is the term i think of for myself, but that word is fuzzy and describes many different things. i am neither/or, and while i am indifferent to pronouns and reasonably-descriptive labels, i don't do single-gender activities and feel uncomfortable using non-unisex public restrooms. i also have a very hard time respecting that other people do have gender identity, but i work on it and consciously make the attempt.    *i'm excessively romantic; both in that i view the whole world through the magical lenses of <a class=\"ilink\" href= \"/interests?i=imagination\">imagination</a>, transforming every action into sword-swinging heroics or the unending tyranny of pain; and in that i fall in love in a consuming, psychotic fashion. these two related qualities interact to the creation of vast excitement and explosions.    *i have this consistent fear that deep down i have a prudish streak left over from my fundamentalist upbringing. this is a large part of why i once worked in a titty bar for the <a class=\"ilink\" href= \"/interests?i=lulz\">lulz</a>.    *i suffer from depression and dysphoria, and enjoy every minute of random hallucinations.    *i want to pop your zits. dancing improbable modern variations of vintage ballroom dances (plus other things) with nerds at a church in palo alto. no seriously, it's great. i spend a very large amount of time thinking about <a class=\"ilink\" href=\"/interests?i=time+travel\">time travel</a>, superpowers, the physical implications of superpowers, what to do during and after a nuclear/biological/economic/zombie apocalypse, and how i would phrase wishes if said wishes were being granted by the devil. and if this dress makes me look fat.    also, the following topics:    <a

\"/interests?i=neil+gaiman\">neil gaiman</a>, hound and falcon series by judith tarr, <a class=\"ilink\" href= \"/interests?i=book+of+the+new+sun\">book of the new sun</a> by gene wolf, the <a class=\"ilink\" href= \"/interests?i=fifth+millennium\">fifth millennium</a> series.    i enjoy <a class=\"ilink\" href= \"/interests?i=speculative+fiction\">speculative fiction</a> in general. i also enjoy reading textbooks. i also like <a class= \"ilink\" href=\"/interests?i=poetry\">poetry</a>, and my favorite poets are <a class=\"ilink\" href=\"/interests?i=don%0amarquis\">don marquis</a>, <a

byron</a>    movies: i like arthaus cinema and terrible terrible sci-fi and kung fu flicks. i love some stupid shit like zoolander and orgazmo. i went about two and a half years without seeing any movies except at the indie theater, which i acknowledged made me a douche.    music: i enjoy goth rock, psychedelic 60s rock, industrial, hippie music, <a class=\"ilink\" href=\"/interests?i=nerdcore\">nerdcore</a> hiphop, well-done filk, spooky triphop, and creepy balladeers. i listen to that electronica that everyone thinks is underground but really isn't, and maybe a little bit that actually is. i like classical music that sounds like the soundtrack to a thunderstorm or as if it was written in the throes of madness. i've got a thing for mashups. bands and artists that i particularly like include: amanda palmer covenant, delirium, don mclean, einsturzende neubauten, jefferson airplane, johnny cash, joy division, justin sullivan, kmfdm, lal waterson, led zeppelin, leonard cohen, live, mc frontalot, neil young, nick cave, nine inch nails, random access memory, sam phillips, simon and garfunkel, siouxsie and the banshees, smashing pumpkins, tenacious d, the austin lounge lizards, the beatles, the cure, the doors, the dresden dolls, the sisters of mercy, the strand, the who, tori amos, beethoven, bartok, bach, chopin, shostakovich, wagner    food: indian, thai, and middle eastern are my favorite. i also really like fruit, mint, dark chocolate, and goat cheese. after 15 years as a lacto-ovo vegetarian, i'm trying to add fish back into my diet for health reasons. thus far the fish still fight back. also, i drink more <a class=\"ilink\" href=\"/interests?i=hot+tea\">hot tea</a> than your english grandmother.    and then things from each of those categories that people seem to think are awesome but that i hate: dan brown, magnolia, techno remixes of classical music (yes, even that carmina burana remix that you think i'll just love), and okra. what the hell is wrong with okra? even indian spicing can't save it. i have blue hair and a <a class=\"ilink\" href= \"/interests?i=surreal+quality\">surreal quality</a>. maybe that i'm riding a bicycle in a bustle skirt. <a class=\"ilink\" href=\"/interests?i=spatial+reasoning\">spatial reasoning</a>, <a class=\"ilink\" href= \"/interests?i=pattern+recognition\">pattern recognition</a>, <a class=\"ilink\" href=\"/interests?i=systems\">systems</a>, anything self-referential.    i change my mind on major worldview-affecting issues when presented with new data at the drop of a hat. i am frighteningly empathetic (and while usually i'm very accurate at reading people, this is also exploited by my friends to make me feel sorry for inanimate objects). i'm rather stronger than the average human, and i have a high pain tolerance and a mutant healing factor and the ability to fold most of my joints into improbable configurations.    i've been told that my singing is like unto the sirens', i can usually make music come out of anything that has strings, and i get a lot of compliments on my dancing. not my laundry.    bicycling. trying to get more exercise. screachily practicing the violin. reading and posting to a very high volume email list of which i have been a member for 8 years now. haxx0ring b0xx0rs. wearing fancy clothes and prancing and dancing. this may include fancy dancing (vintage ballroom), prancy dancing (folk dance or choreographed dancing), and chancy dancing (social mostly-partner dancing in which any dance could happen). at some point there will be francy dancing (can-can).    i tend to move a lot. i moved to san francisco in april '10. i have hopes that it will hold my attention for more than a few years, unlike other places. 2 years in, and i love it and am home.    also i do \"stuff with computers,\" \"for a living\", as the kids say these days. i like cold, unfeeling machines and their beautiful logic. i worked a whole lot, courting workaholism, for a startup for the last year. i'm indulging in a few months of dilletantery at the moment. note: i am not sane, down to earth, or easy going. i feel this is important to tell people since so many people list these qualities as necessary.    i am whimsical as fuck. i'm not quite as delightfully <a class= \"ilink\" href=\"/interests?i=bohemian\">bohemian</a> as i once was. i like <a class=\"ilink\" href=\"/interests?i=gothic\">gothic</a> aesthetics and <a class=\"ilink\" href= \"/interests?i=hippie\">hippie</a> <a class=\"ilink\" href= \"/interests?i=ideals\">ideals</a>. i like <a class=\"ilink\" href= \"/interests?i=geek\">geek</a>y diversions and <a class=\"ilink\" href= \"/interests?i=nerd\">nerd</a>y stimulations, without the dorky lack of grace.    i am an atheist (though much like fox mulder, i want to believe), a pantheist, and a <a class=\"ilink\" href= \"/interests?i=unitarian+universalist\">unitarian universalist</a>. i am also a <a class=\"ilink\" href= \"/interests?i=fairy%0aprincess\">fairy princess</a>. luckily for me, technology sufficiently advanced is indistinguishable from magic. metaphysically.    i am fueled by love, unholy rage, and dissatisfaction.    i am extremely arrogant, and i think humility is a hypocritical ideal in our society. it is rude, however, to inform people that they're plebes. i have bouts of extremely low self esteem that stem from the extremely high standards i would like to and try to embody. i don't live up to my own expectations. neither does anyone else. that is how i want it.    i'm incredibly spacey and detached. i leave my head places despite the fact that it is attached to my neck. my mind wanders. i'm fairly incapable of mentally single-tasking. related to all of these items, i prefer conversation with people who can carry on interlocked conversations about unrelated topics with no need to segue between topics. related to that, i am an interrupter, and i find it easier to communicate with interrupters. i'm working on communicating differently with people that find that hard to deal with.    i hate puritans. i tend to blame things on puritans, but really, it's usually their fault.    my sense of humor consists of equal parts pretentious academic references and cock jokes.    i have historically identified myself as polyamorous because a)i have lots of feelings for lots of people, and it seems artificial for me to choose or ask someone else to choose, b)i don't like to commoditize people. i enjoy an occasionally dramatic relationship with <a class=\"ilink\"

my capacity to put people at ease. kissing  simplifying complexity  helping people relax  making up an improvisational song  creating turn-on  interrupting trauma  making an omelet a transpersonal counselor, writer, poet, musician, sexological bodyworker, and somatic experiencing practitioner my work focuses on encouraging the experience of transcending trauma &amp; sexual shame while helping people expand their embodiment of erotic states of consciousness.    toured on the road singing vocal jazz &amp; classical music and had many hours singing &amp; producing music in recording studios. have a passion for playing guitar &amp; piano &amp; composing a variety of original music while enjoying supporting other musicians with their musical projects!    i spent nearly a decade as a computer network engineer for both small &amp; large corporations. i can repair computers &amp; networks, program switches, hubs &amp; routers, setup a vpn or a vlan cloud &amp; problem solve with facts. i decided to leave the corporate world because i prefer to focus my attention on people way more than machines!    can read manuals or maps and i'm the kind of man who can ask for directions when temporarily lost!    after taking many communication classes i value a compassionate communication style to high drama. i can fight fair using radical honesty but i will do it with a lot of heart. taking responsibility for not anticipating the needs of others while providing empathy for unmet needs i can acknowledge is a welcome skill. i'm a 5th generation san franciscan, and except for 2 years in chilly northern minnesota have lived in the bay area my entire life. i've traveled to 17 countries and 45 of the 50 states.    values of loyalty, authenticity, good communication &amp; clear ethical standards are vital. having deep intimate relationships with others &amp; a wide circle of friends is important. when we strive to protect another's solitude we deepen the capacity for love. i gravitate toward others who seek to create a world where we can all have more fun, joy, pleasure as well as more opportunities to live sustainable, sharing, authentic lives with less grasping of i, me &amp; mine.    since 19 i've been a nudist &amp; am as comfortable in clothes as out of them. \n",

In TF-IDF, we weight this term frequency by the inverse of its popularity in all documents. For example, if the word \"movie\" showed up in all the documents, it would not have much predictive value. It could actually be considered a stopword. By weighing its counts by 1 divided by its overall frequency, we downweight it. We can then use this TF-IDF weighted features as inputs to any classifier. TF-IDF is essentially a measure of term importance, and of how discriminative a word is in a corpus. There are a variety of nuances involved in computing TF-IDF, mainly involving where to add the smoothing term to avoid division by 0, or log of 0 errors. The formula for TF-IDF in scikit-learn differs from that of most textbooks:\n",
